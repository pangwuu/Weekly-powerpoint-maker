Turn your eyes upon Jesus (Oh, turn, oh, turn)
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things (The things) of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace

[Verse 1]
O soul are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior
And life more abundant and free

[Verse 2]
Through death into life everlasting
He passed and we follow Him there
Over us, sin no more hath dominion
For more than conquerors we are

[Chorus]
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus (Oh, turn, oh, turn)
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things (The things) of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace

[Verse 3]
His word shall not fail you, He promised
Believe Him and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus (Oh, turn, oh, turn)
Look full in His wonderful face
Oh, and the things (The things) of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace

[Outro]
Oh, turn your— Oh, turn your—
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus
Oh, turn your— Hey, oh, turn your—
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus
Oh, turn your— Oh, turn your—
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus
Oh, turn your— Oh, turn your—
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus
Oh, turn your— Oh, turn your—
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus
Oh, turn your— Oh, turn your—
Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus
