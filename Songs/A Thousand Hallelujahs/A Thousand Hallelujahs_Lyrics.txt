Who else would rocks cry out to worship?
Whose glory taught the stars to shine?
Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
But this joy is mine
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
Who else would die for our redemption?
Whose resurrection means I'll rise?
There isn't time enough to sing of all You've done
But I have eternity to try
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
Praise to the Lord
To the lamb
To the King of Heaven
Praise for He rose
Now He reigns
We will sing forever
Praise to the Lord
To the lamb
To the King of Heaven
Praise for He rose
Now He reigns
We will sing forever
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
Praise to the Lord
To the lamb
To the king of heaven
Praise for He rose
Now He reigns
We will sing forever
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
