8 ContributorsTransfiguration (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1]
From the cloud You speak
What was veiled now is seen
Jesus the image of
The invisible God

[Verse 2]
Divinity confirmed
In the transfigured Word
A kingdom once concealed
On the earth now revealed
(Come on, we sing)

[Chorus]
Holy is the Lord revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart can scarcely take it in
As I behold Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing
Is hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, my King

[Verse 3]
Lead my longing heart
To the high ground, to a clear view
And in awe, I'll be there
Beholding You
You might also like[Chorus]
Holy is the Lord revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart can scarcely take it in
As I behold Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing
Is hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, my King
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, my King

[Bridge]
Now I know, I have seen (Come on)
Your glory that cannot be unseen
I am changed, changing still
As I look upon You, Lord and believe
(Oh holy)

[Chorus]
Holy is the Lord revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart can scarcely take it in
As I behold Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing, yeah
Is hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, my King
(Oh God)
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, my King (Oh hallelujah)
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, my King
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, my King

[Outro]
Is hallelujah
Hallelujah, my King
