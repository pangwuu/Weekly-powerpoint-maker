Confidence Lyrics
7 ContributorsConfidence Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not a warrior, I'm too afraid to lose
I feel unqualified for what You're calling me to
But Lord with Your strength, I've got no excuse
'Cause broken people are exactly who You use

[Chorus]
So give me faith like Daniel in the lion's den
Give me hope like Moses in the wilderness
Give me a heart like David, Lord be my defense
So I can face my giants with confidence

[Verse 2]
You took a shepherd boy and made him a King
So I'm gonna trust You and give You everything
I'll be a conqueror, 'cause You fight for me
I'll be a champion claiming Your victory

[Chorus]
So give me faith like Daniel in the lion's den
Give me hope like Moses in the wilderness
Give me a heart like David, Lord be my defense
So I can face my giants with confidence

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing and shout and shake the walls
I won't stop until I see them fall
I'm gonna stand up, step out when You call
Jesus, Jesus
I'm gonna sing and shout and shake the walls
I won't stop until I see them fall
I'm gonna stand up, step out when You call
Jesus

Give me faith like Daniel in the lion's den
Give me hope like Moses in the wilderness
Give me a heart like David, Lord be my defense
So I can face my giants with confidence, yeah!...
Give me faith like Daniel in the lion's den
Give me hope like Moses in the wilderness
Give me a heart like David, Lord be my defense
So I can face my giants with confidence

[Outro]
I'll face my giants with confidence
