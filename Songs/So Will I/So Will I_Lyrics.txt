So Will I Lyrics
1 ContributorSo Will I LyricsGod of Creation
There at the start before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of life
And as You Speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapor of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see your heart in everything you've made
Every burning star a signal fire of grace
If creation sings your praises so will I
So will I
God of your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science follow the sound of Your voice
And as you speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals your nature so will I
You might also likeI can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky a canvas of Your Grace
If creation still obeys you so will I
So will I
If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high
So will I
If the wind goes where you send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still fall shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times
Whoa Whoa
Whoa Whoa
God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill you created
Light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die
And as you speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where you lost your life so I could find it here
If you left the grave behind you so will I
I can see your heart in everything you have done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If you gladly chose surrender so will I
I can see your heart a billion different ways
Every precious one a child you died to save
If you gave your life to love them so will I
Like you would again a hundred billion times
What measure could amount to your desire
You're the one who never leaves the one behind
