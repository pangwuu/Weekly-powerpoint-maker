O Praise The Name (An√°stasis) Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I cast my mind to Calvary
Where Jesus bled and died for me
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
My Saviour on that cursed tree

[Verse 2]
His body bound and drenched in tears
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
The entrance sealed by heavy stone
Messiah still and all alone

[Chorus]
O praise the Name of the Lord, our God
O praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord, our God

[Verse 3]
Then on the third at break of dawn
The Son of heaven rose again
O trampled death, where is your sting?
The angels roar for Christ the King

[Chorus]
O praise the Name of the Lord, our God
O praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord, our God

[Verse 4]
He shall return in robes of white
The blazing sun shall pierce the night
And I will rise among the saints
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face

[Chorus]
O praise the Name of the Lord, our God
O praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord, our God
O praise the Name of the Lord, our God
O praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord, our God
Oh Lord, oh Lord, our God
