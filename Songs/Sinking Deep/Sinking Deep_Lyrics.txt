Sinking Deep Lyrics
8 ContributorsSinking Deep Lyrics[Verse 1]
Standing here in Your presence
In a grace so relentless
I am won
Oh, by perfect love
Wrapped within the arms of heaven
In a peace that lasts forever
Sinking deep
In mercy's sea

[Chorus]
I'm wide awake
Drawing close, stirred by grace
And all my heart is Yours
All fear removed
I breathe You in, I lean into
Your love
Oh, Your love

[Verse 2]
When I'm lost, You pursue me
Lift my head to see Your glory
Lord of all
So beautiful
Here in You, I find shelter
Captivated by the splendour
Of Your face
Oh, my secret place
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm wide awake
Drawing close, stirred by grace
And all my heart is Yours
All fear removed
I breathe You in, I lean into
Your love
Oh, Your love

[Bridge]
Your love so deep
Is washing over me
Your face is all I seek
You are my everything
Jesus Christ
You are my one desire
Lord, hear my only cry
To know You all my life
Love so deep
Is washing over me
Your face is all I seek
You are my everything
Jesus Christ
You are my one desire
Lord, hear my only cry
To know You all my life

[Chorus]
I'm wide awake
Drawing close, stirred by grace
And all my heart is Yours
All fear removed
I breathe You in, I lean into
Your love
Oh, Your love
