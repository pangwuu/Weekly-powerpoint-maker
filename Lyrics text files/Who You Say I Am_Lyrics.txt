[Verse 1]
Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh His love for me
Oh His love for me

[Chorus]
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am

[Verse 2]
Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes He died for me

[Chorus]
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am

[Bridge]
I am chosen, not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me, not against me
I am who You say I am
I am chosen, not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me, not against me
I am who You say I am
I am who You say I am

[Chorus]
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
