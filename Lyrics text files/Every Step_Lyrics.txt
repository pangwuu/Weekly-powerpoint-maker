Every Step (Live) Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I can sing with my whole heart, I have all I need
In Jesus, my Saviour, my joy is complete
Onward to glory yet here I will wait
I will trust in Christ every step I take

[Verse 2]
I am sure of Your promise to guide me each day
Though some may oppose me, I won't be ashamed
Whatever I face, Lord, it won't be in vain
I will trust in Christ every step I take

[Chorus]
For all of my days, I will live for Your glory
Running with courage and faith
The prize of my journey, the joy of salvation
To meet my King face to face

[Verse 3]
So I'm looking to Jesus, perfector of faith
My heart set on heaven where treasure awaits
I'll run with endurance to finish the race
I will trust in Christ every step I take

[Chorus]
For all of my days, I will live for Your glory
Running with courage and faith
The prize of my journey, the joy of salvation
To meet my King face to face

[Bridge]
I will, I will rejoice
Whatever comes my way
God You're faithful to save
I will, I will rejoice
I know that God is with me always
I will, I will rejoice
Whatever comes my way
God You're faithful to save
I will, I will rejoice
I know that God is with me always
I will, I will rejoice
Whatever comes my way
God You're faithful to save
I will, I will rejoice
I know that God is with me always

[Chorus]
For all of my days, I will live for Your glory
Running with courage and faith
The prize of my journey, the joy of salvation
To meet my King face to face
To meet my King face to face
To meet my King face to face
