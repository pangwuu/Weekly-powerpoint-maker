I am giving you a new commandment

[Interlude]

I am giving you a new commandment
I am giving you a new commandment
Love one another, love one another

[Chorus]
In the same way I have loved you
In the same way I have loved you

I am giving you a new commandment
I am giving you a new commandment
Love one another, love one another

In the same way I have loved you
In the same way I have loved you
In the same way I have loved you
In the same way I have loved you!

Then everyone will know who we follow
Then our lives will show we are changed
Then everyone will know it's You we follow
Then our lives will show how we are changed!
