Blessed Assurance Lyrics
2 ContributorsBlessed Assurance Lyrics

[Verse 1]
All my attempts to be satisfied were vain and empty
Until the moment You rescued me and Your love filled me
My soul sings, now my soul sings

[Chorus]
What blessed assurance
I've found in You, I've found in You
I won't be shaken, I will not be moved
How steadfast Your strong hand
Is keeping me, is keeping me
I won't be shaken, I will not be moved
O blessed assurance

[Verse 2]
No other love that I've ever known compares to You, God
No other love that I've ever found has done what You've done
My soul sings, now my soul sings

[Chorus]
What blessed assurance
I've found in You, I've found in You
I won't be shaken, I will not be moved
How steadfast Your strong hand
Is keeping me, is keeping me
I won't be shaken, I will not be moved
O blessed assurance

[Bridge]
Ever my anchor, ever my strength
Ever my portion, and all I need
Ever my healing, ever my hope
Ever the truth that leads me home
That leads me home

[Chorus]
What blessed assurance
I've found in You, I've found in You
I won't be shaken, I will not be moved
How steadfast Your strong hand
Is keeping me, is keeping me
I won't be shaken, I will not be moved
Oh, what blessed assurance
I've found in You, I've found in You
I won't be shaken, I will not be moved
How steadfast Your strong hand
Is keeping me, is keeping me
I won't be shaken, I will not be moved
O blessed assurance
