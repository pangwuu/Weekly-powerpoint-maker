Thrive Lyrics
8 ContributorsThrive Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here in this worn and weary land
Where many a dream has died
Like a tree planted by the water
We never will run dry

[Pre-Chorus]
So living water flowing through
God we thirst for more of You
Fill our hearts and flood our souls
With one desire

[Chorus]
Just to know You and
To make You known
We lift Your name on High
Shine like the sun make darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive

[Verse 2]
Into Your word we're digging deep
To know our Father's heart
Into the world we're reaching out
To show them who You are
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So living water flowing through
God we thirst for more of You
Fill our hearts and flood our souls
With one desire

[Chorus]
Just to know You and
To make You known
We lift Your name on High
Shine like the sun make darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive

[Bridge]
Joy Unspeakable, Faith Unsinkable
Love Unstoppable, Anything is possible
Joy Unspeakable, Faith Unsinkable
Love Unstoppable, Anything is possible
Joy Unspeakable, Faith Unsinkable
Love Unstoppable, Anything is possible
Joy Unspeakable, Faith Unsinkable
Love Unstoppable, Anything is possible

[Chorus]
Just to know You and
To make You known
We lift Your name on High
Shine like the sun make darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive

[Outro]
We were made to thrive
