[Verse 1]
Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

[Chorus]
And here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

[Verse 2]
King of all days
Oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly you came to the earth you created
All for love's sake became poor

[Chorus]
And here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

[Bridge]
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross

[Bridge]
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross

[Bridge]
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross
I'll never know
How much it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross

[Chorus]
And here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

[Chorus]
And here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
