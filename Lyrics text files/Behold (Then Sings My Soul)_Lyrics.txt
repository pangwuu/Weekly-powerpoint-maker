Behold (Then Sings My Soul) [Live] Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Behold the Father's heart
The mystery He lavishes on us
As deep cries out to deep
Oh, how desperately He wants us
The things of earth stand next to Him
Like a candle to the sun
Unfailing Father
What compares to His great love

[Verse 2]
Behold His holy Son
The Lion and the Lamb given to us
The Word became a man
That my soul should know its Saviour
Forsaken for the sake of all mankind
Salvation is in His blood
Jesus Messiah
The righteous died for love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It wasn't over
For He is the risen One

[Chorus 1]
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Then sings my soul

[Verse 3]
Behold I have a friend
The Spirit breathing holy fire within
My ever present help
Speaking truth when I can't find it
Light up this broken heart and light my way
'Til my time on earth is do-one
Oh, Holy Spirit
Breathe in me like Kingdom come

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, Holy Spirit
Let Your work in me be done

[Chorus 2]
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Then sings my soul

[Verse 4]
My God
He who was and is to come
Prepare the way
Until the work on earth is done
Watch as the clouds He rides swing low
Lift up the sound
As He makes our praise His thro-one
Behold the Lord our God will lead us home
