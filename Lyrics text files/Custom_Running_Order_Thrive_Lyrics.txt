[Verse 1]
Here in this worn and weary land
Where many a dream has died
Like a tree planted by the water
We never will run dry

[Chorus]
Just to know You and
To make You known
We lift Your name on High
Shine like the sun make darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive

[Verse 1]
Here in this worn and weary land
Where many a dream has died
Like a tree planted by the water
We never will run dry

[Chorus]
Just to know You and
To make You known
We lift Your name on High
Shine like the sun make darkness run and hide
We know we were made for so much more
Than ordinary lives
It's time for us to more than just survive
We were made to thrive
